[Pyco](http://github.com/LeeHolmes/pyco) is a fully featured command-line calculator designed for everyday use and maximum utility. Visit the Pyco repo to see all of the fancy things it can do!

If you want a fancy GUI app to use it with that can sit in your taskbar, a regular console window won't really cut it. To solve this problem, pycoterm is the retro pyco terminal you're looking for. It automatically downloads pyco as a dependency and then makes it a treat to use.

### Features

Pycoterm supports:

- Cool retro CRT look
- Syntax highlighting of input
- Tab completion and traditional shell keyboard navigation

### Pycoterm on the web
In addition to Pycoterm as a separate download, you can also use Pyco directly online: https://www.leeholmes.com/projects/pyco. This is implemented as a Progressive Web App, letting you install it on Android and it will still work offline.
